# analytics-capstone
Capstone project for my business analytics degree.

Utilized Python to predict fraudulent bank applications utilizing data generated from real, anonymized examples. The main challenge faced was the imbalanced nature of the dataset, as fraud rates tend to be very low in industry. A discussion of how the models were evaluated and selected are discussed. Effort was made to tune the models through common hyperparameters, but the extent of this was limited due to the processing power of my machine.
